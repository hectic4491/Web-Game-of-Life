class Simulation ():
    """A class used to represent the Game of Life Simulation. The class
    is inteded to be a data wrapper to automate generation and data prep
    for the front end simulation request. After creating an object, grab
    the data from the .render_data attribute.

    Creating a simulation object will generate a grid of size height x 
    width. Then a pattern will be applied (the default being the random
    pattern) on the initial generation of cells. The simulation then 
    runs and writes the necessary data to the attribute .render_data
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    height : int
        The height of the simulation grid
    width : int
        The width of the simulation grid
    steps : int
        The amount of steps to run the simulation
    pattern : list
        The pattern used to initialize the simulation.
        Defaults to None. i.e. The internal class initializes the
        default random pattern.

    Public Attributes
    ----------
    render_data : list
        The data to be sent to the front end. The contents of each
        element in the list is a dictionary. The dictionary has the
        following keys:

    (key) 'alive' : list
            the list of newly alive cell coordinates
    (dead) 'dead' : list
            the list of newly dead cell coordinates
    (key) 'population' : int
            the amount of cells currently alive
    (key) 'generation' : int
            the current generation index

### NOTES ###
# generate_grid() takes in a single argument for it's grid size. We
# should instead have it take two distinct aguments for it's rows and
# columns. This is tricky because we use the equivalent states of a
# matrix depending on the sitatuation.
#
# grid_size[0] == number of columns == length of a row = 82
#
# grid_size[1] == number of rows == length of a column = 36
#
# # data = GenArray([82, 36], 300).gen_array
#
#   # resolutions get listed as: w x h   e.g.: 1920x1080
#                                          == # of elements x # of rows
#
#   The matrix 'grid' would be a 3 x 4 matrix. i.e. m x n: m = 3, n = 4
#
#   m == number of rows = 3
#   n == number of columns i.e. elements per row = 4
#
#   grid =[
#       [1, 0, 1, 0],
#    m  [0, 1, 0, 0],
#       [0, 0, 0, 1],
#       ]     n
#
#   a(j,i)
#       1 <= i <= m
#       1 <= j <= n
#
#   gird[0] = [1, 0, 1, 0]
#   grid[0][0] = 1
#
#   These are Equivalent statements about the grid object.
#
#    grid.length
#    == j ??
#    == m = 3 ( in our matrix example )
#    == length of the grid
#**  == number of subarrays
#    == number of rows
#    == height of display
#    == length of a column
#    == grid_size[1]
#    == 36 ( in our JavaScript simulation)
#
#   And,
#
#    grid[i].length
#    == i ??
#    == n = 4 ( in our matrix example )
#    == length of a subarray
#**  == number of elements in subarray
#    == number of columns
#    == width of display
#    == length of a row
#    == grid_size[0]
#    == 82 ( in our JavaScript simulation)
#
#  And,
#
#   grid[i][j]
#   == index of a cell
#   == div element id? (not sure about this one)
#
#
#   If I start using a numpy 2D array, accessing looks like:
#   arr[0, 1]; where we access "the second element on the first row"
#   Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns. Where the
#   Dimension represents the row and the index represents the column.
#   arr[r, c]
#   arr[m, n]
#   arr[h, w]
#   arr[j, i]
#
# We would like to know how big to make the alive_set array, so that
# we could pre-allocate the necessary space in memory.
# It needs to be large enough to fit every alive cell's coordinates.
# The coordinates for each alive cell are stored in a set of the
# form {j, i}, where j is the row index and i is the column index.
#
# We can't know how many cells are going to exist in each generation
# however, we could supply a statistically implied lower limit.
# On a random pattern, a grid of size m x n will most likely have
# around (m x n) / 4 amount of alive cells on its initial generation.
# (because of our 25% dice roll to become alive).
#
# e.g.: An intial random pattern grid of size (36, 82) will
# have on average: (36 x 82) / 4 = 738 alive members on it's first
# initial generation. So the we should consider this the lower limit
# of the required array size.
#
# I'll choose twice the lower limit to be my pre-allocated array
# size for now.
#
#
#
#
# Let A be generation N's set of alive cell's coordinates.
# Let B be generation N-1's set of alive cell's coordinates.
#
# Then:
#   A âˆ© B is the set of cells that stay alive. Therefore, no need to
#          update.
#   A - B is the set of cells that became alive. Therefore, we need to
#       update the background color as "alive".
#   B - A is the set of cells that became dead. Therefore, we need
#       to update the background color as "dead".
